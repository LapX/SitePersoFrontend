Frontend for my personnal website : https://lapx.github.io/SitePersoFrontend/#/

Currently consists of a homepage and a dashboard loaded with random data.

I plan to add a few dashboard components and add persistance.

Users will be able to log in with their google account and create a custom dashboard.

It will be stored in a database and displayed when the user logs back in.
